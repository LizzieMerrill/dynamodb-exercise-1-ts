In this exercise, you will:

Create a DynamoDB table named “follows” that keeps track of which users are following each other (as in Twitter).
Create a secondary index named “follows_index” on the “follows” table.
Write a program that uses the AWS SDK to insert, update, and delete items in the “follows” table
